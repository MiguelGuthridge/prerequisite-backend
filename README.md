# Waydriver Backend

Waydriver is a cutting-edge task management system that empowers you to conquer
complex projects with ease. Seamlessly break down your projects into tasks, map
their interdependencies, and chart the optimal route to achieve your goals.

## This is a work in progress

I'm planning to continue working on this in my spare time. Currently, it is not
in a workable state, and probably won't be for some time (there isn't even a
frontend yet). Hopefully it'll be ready to try out soon!

## Roadmap

These are the things I'm hoping to tackle, probably in this order.

* [ ] Basic task management
* [ ] Basic frontend
* [ ] Path-finding algorithm
* [ ] Task completion interface in frontend
* [ ] Task dimensions (eg, estimated time, priority, number of spoons, maybe
      custom dimensions as well)
* [ ] Path-finding algorithm that lets users prioritise dimensions

I'm not sure where I'll go from there - this project is primarily designed to
match my own needs for a task management system, so after I've got the basic
stuff working, I'll add things as I see fit.
